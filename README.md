# LeetCode Solved Problems

| # | Title | Description | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Two Sum | Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. | [Solution](twosum.js) |
| 7 | Reverse Integer | Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. | [Solution](reverse_integer.js) |
| 8 | String to Integer (atoi) | Implement atoi which converts a string to an integer. | [Solution](string_to_integer.js) |
| 65 | Valid Number | Validate if a given string can be interpreted as a decimal number. | [Solution](valid_number.js) |
| 665 | Non-decreasing Array | Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element. We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2). | [Solution](non_decreasing_array.js) |
| 709 | To Lower Case | Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase. | [Solution](to_lower_case.js) |
| 771 | Jewels and Stones | You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A". | [Solution](jewels_and_stones.js) |
| 1108 | Defanging an IP Address | Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address. A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]". | [Solution](ip_defanging.js) |
| 1281 | Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer | Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits. | [Solution](subtract_product_and_sum_integer.js) |
| 1295 | Numbers with Even Number of Digits | Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits. | [Solution](numbers_even_number_of_digits.js) |
| 1313 | Decompress Run-Length Encoded List | We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding. Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list. | [Solution](decompress_run_length_encoded_list.js) |
| 1342 | Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero | Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it. | [Solution](reduce_to_zero.js) |
| 1365 | How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number | Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. | [Solution](numbers_smaller_than_current.js) |
