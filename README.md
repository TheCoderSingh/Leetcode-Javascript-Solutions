| 9 | Palindrome Number | Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise. | [Solution](palindrome.js) |
| 12 | Integer to Roman | Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. | [Solution](integer_to_roman.js) |
| 13 | Roman to Integer | Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. | [Solution](roman_to_integer.js) |
| 14 | Longest Common Prefix | Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. | [Solution](longest_common_prefix.js) |

| 65 | Valid Number | Validate if a given string can be interpreted as a decimal number. | [Solution](valid_number.js) |
| 94 | Binary Tree Inorder Traversal | Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values. | [Solution](binary_tree_inorder_traversal.js) |
| 104 | Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. | [Solution](maximum_depth_binary_tree.js) |
| 204 | Count Primes | Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, n. | [Solution](count_primes.js) |
| 344 | Reverse String | Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s. | [Solution](reverse_string.js) |
| 595 | Big Countries | A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million. Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area. | [Solution](big_countries.sql) |
| 620 | Not Boring Movies | Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.| [Solution](not_boring_movies.sql) |
| 665 | Non-decreasing Array | Given an array nums with n integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element. We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2). | [Solution](non_decreasing_array.js) |
| 709 | To Lower Case | Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase. | [Solution](to_lower_case.js) |
| 771 | Jewels and Stones | You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A". | [Solution](jewels_and_stones.js) |
| 922 | Sort Array By Parity II | Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even. Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even. Return any answer array that satisfies this condition. | [Solution](sort_array_parity.js) |
| 1108 | Defanging an IP Address | Given a valid (IPv4) IP address, return a defanged version of that IP address. A defanged IP address replaces every period "." with "[.]". | [Solution](ip_defanging.js) |
| 1207 | Unique Number of Occurrences | Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique. | [Solution](unique_occurrences.js) |
| 1281 | Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer | Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits. | [Solution](subtract_product_and_sum_integer.js) |
| 1295 | Numbers with Even Number of Digits | Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits. | [Solution](numbers_even_number_of_digits.js) |
| 1313 | Decompress Run-Length Encoded List | We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding. Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list. | [Solution](decompress_run_length_encoded_list.js) |
| 1342 | Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero | Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it. | [Solution](reduce_to_zero.js) |
| 1365 | How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number | Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. | [Solution](numbers_smaller_than_current.js) |
| 1431 | Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies| For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies. | [Solution](greatest_number_of_candies.js) |
| 1470 | Shuffle the Array | Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]. Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]. | [Solution](shuffle_array.js) |
| 1476 | Subrectangle Queries | Implement the class SubrectangleQueries which receives a rows x cols rectangle as a matrix of integers in the constructor and supports two methods. | [Solution](subrectangle_queries.js) |
| 1480 | Running Sum of 1d Array | Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]). Return the running sum of nums. | [Solution](sum_1d_array.js) |
| 1486 | XOR Operation in an Array | Given an integer n and an integer start. Define an array nums where nums[i] = start + 2\*i (0-indexed) and n == nums.length. Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of nums. | [Solution](xor_array.js) |
| 1512 | Number of Good Pairs | Given an array of integers nums. A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j. Return the number of good pairs. | [Solution](number_good_pairs.js) |
| 1528 | Shuffle String | Given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string. | [Solution](shuffle_string.js) |
| 1603 | Design Parking System | Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size. | [Solution](parking_system.js) |
| 1672 | Richest Customer Wealth | You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the ith customer has in the jth bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has. A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth. | [Solution](richest_customer_wealth.js) | |
